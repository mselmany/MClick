#CodeIgniter (2.2.0)

##Using the Pack
To use the Pack, we created 2 menu options, which you can find on the right of the menu. These menus can be configured in the `.codio` file.

1. **PHP Version** : This will show you the version of PHP installed.
1. **Preview** : This previews your app. Note the Preview menu allows you to select 'Inside Codio' or 'New Browser Tab'. 

##Accessing the application
To access your application from a browser, you can use the menu option described above. The url of your CodeIgniter project can be found in the `Project->Box Info` menu and will look something like this

```
https://vital-ego.box.codio.io:9500/
```

We set this up using https so it can be previewed inside a Codio Tab.

##How the Pack was prepared
This Starter Pack was built on the `LAMP` Codio Certified Stack.
